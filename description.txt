Are day counter mods in Terraria too inaccurate for you?
Well, look no further than this epic mod that definitely was coded by a competent person!
You better be excited because this was made in like 30 minutes after seeing a request on the tModLoader Discord!

Changelog:
v1.0: tracks days & nights, UI implementation paired with configurable keybinds
v1.1: added changelog, created a config to alter how text is displayed to your liking, added icon
v1.2: fixed issue with Show Icon config option not working
v1.3: fixed bug that caused day count to increase upon reload
v1.4: fixed bug preventing counter from increasing (god why is this such a difficult feature to make accurate)
v1.5: updated text to prevent it from clipping into icon when longer than usual
v1.6: moved the UI up a little bit
v1.7: fixed bug that caused player's day count to increase upon loading a world that hadn't been loaded with the Day Counter mod
v1.8: 1.4.4 support
v1.9: Add anchoring, allowing you to move the Day Counter around your screen to a location you desire

All source code is available via extraction through tModLoader.
